**Version**: 1.0.0 <!--(increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)-->

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This is an application to allow someone to search a location and pull some information about that location like weather, map, yelp and movie reviews. Allowing someone to look at their searched location and get some relavent data about it.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Must have a front end and back end to run the seperate functionality necessary. The back end must access the search and find relavent data. The front end must be able to input a search and render relavent data in an astetically pleasing manner.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We used the languages of javascript, JSON, html, and css. We used the Google Maps Platform API, Dark Skys API, Yelp API, Movies DB API. We used the express, dotenv, and cors node modules.

## Change Log
