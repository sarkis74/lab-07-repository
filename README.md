# lab-06-back-end

**Authors**: Sarkis and Anthony
**Version**: 1.0.0 <!--(increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)-->

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This is an application to allow someone to search a location and pull some information about that location like weather, map, and yelp reviews. Allowing someone to look at their searched location and get some relavent data about it.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Must have a front end and back end to run the seperate functionality necessary. The back end must access the search and find relavent data. The front end must be able to input a search and render relavent data in an astetically pleasing manner.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We used the languages of javascript, JSON, html, and css. We used the Google Maps Platform API, and Dark Skys API. We used the express, dotenv, and cors node modules.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
